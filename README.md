Do you have a pretty plot you would like to share with the rest of the astronomy community? Wonderful! We require an image (in **png** or **jpg** format) of your beautiful plot/figure, a title, a caption (can contain Latex symbols) and the source code used to create it. The source code might need to be modified (e.g., adding comments, changing variable names) so anyone can understand it. Optionally, you can add your name, affiliation, link to the original plot/figure (e.g., publication, website). Also, don't forget to add tags to your plot (in the `index.md` file). See the available tags under **Gallery** on the website (tags are written in lower case only). Suggestions are welcome!

There are two main ways of contributing:

   1) Via Pull Request (**recommended**): you will need to fork the repository for this (check [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for more info). Create a new directory, with the title of your plot as the name, under `astro-visualization/content/gallery/`. You can copy any of the directories that are already in there. Modify the content of `index.md` however you see fit, but follow the same structure (this is a markdown file). The file containing the image needs to have the name `featured.jpg` or `featured.png`. When you are ready, make the pull request adding a short description. Use the title of your plot as the title of your pull request. It is important to select the option **Allow edits from maintainers**.


   2) Via email: if you are not familiar with Github, no problem! Just send [us](#contributors) all the files via email. Create a file called `metada.txt` all your personal information, the title of the plot, source code, etc., and the file of the image you wish to upload (in **png** or **jpg** format).
