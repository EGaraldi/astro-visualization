A repository for pretty astronomical plots

## Contributing

Do you have a pretty plot you would like to share with the rest of the astronomy community? Wonderful! We require the following:

   * Your name (ideally as it appears on your publications). Affiliation is optional.
   * An image of your plot (use the most common formats (e.g., png, jpg, pdf, etc).
   * The caption of the plot.
   * The source code. We don't require the data, but try to re-write the code to be as generic as possible so others can easilly understand how it works. Don't forget to include comments as a guide.
   * Create a `metada.txt` file with points 1 and 3. Compress all the files (metadata, image and source code) in a single file (zip, tar, etc.).
   * Send it to [us](#contributors)!

In `path/to/somewhere` we have an example (`example_contribution.zip`) of this.
