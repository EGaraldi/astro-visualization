Do you have a pretty plot you would like to share with the rest of the astronomy community? Wonderful! We require the following:

   * Your name (ideally as it appears on your publications) and affiliation (optionals)
   * The link to the original plot (e.g., publication, website, etc. -- optional)
   * The title of the plot
   * The caption of the plot in Latex format, if any
   * Create a `metada.txt` file with all the information from the points above
   * An image of your plot using the most common formats (e.g., png, jpg, pdf, etc)
   * The source code. We don't require the data, but try to re-write the code to be as generic as possible so others can easilly understand how it works and don't forget to include comments as a guide
   * Compress all the files (metadata, image and source code) in a single file (zip, tar, etc.)
   * Send it to [us](https://github.com/temuller/astro-visualization/tree/test_branch#contributors)!

You will find an example on how to contribute on our [Github repository](https://github.com/temuller/astro-visualization).
